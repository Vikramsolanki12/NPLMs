# üß† NPLMs - Neural Probabilistic Language Models

An implementation of Neural Probabilistic Language Models (NPLMs) in Python using PyTorch. This project demonstrates how neural networks can be used to model the probability distribution of words and their contexts, as introduced by Bengio et al. (2003).

## üìå What is an NPLM?

Neural Probabilistic Language Models learn continuous word representations and use a feedforward neural network to predict the probability of a word given its previous context (n-gram). It was one of the earliest models to introduce the concept of word embeddings and paved the way for modern deep NLP models.

- Trains on n-gram-based context windows  
- Learns word embeddings during training  
- Cross-entropy loss minimization  
- Perplexity metric for evaluation  
- Supports custom datasets
